    ## World Extents:
    
    The minimum and maximum in-game world units. Used for mapping normalized coordinates to in-game coordinates.
    
    ```
    WorldExtent.Minimum = (-109199.999997, -94499.99999580906968410989)
    WorldExtent.Maximum = (109199.999997, 94499.99999580906968410989)
    ```
    
    Note: The previous field worldExtents* which was present in every map's data is now a constant and consistent value across all maps since they are all of the same size.
    ## Map Icon Colours
    There might not necessarily be a Colonial/Warden version of an icon. In this case, it is recommended to use these colours for rendering Colonial and Warden versions of that icon.
    
    Colonial
    - `(0.082283, 0.14996, 0.07036, 1.0)`
    - RGB: `(21, 38, 18, 255)`
    - Hex Linear: `152612FF`
    - Hex SRGB: `516C4BFF`
    
    Warden
    - `(0.017642, 0.093059, 0.223228, 1.0)`
    - RGB: `(4, 23, 57, 255)`
    - Hex Linear: `041739FF`
    - Hex SRGB: `245682FF`
    
    ## A0E-9 Rocket Launches (Update 54)
    Rocket Site, Rocket Site With Rocket, Rocket Target, and Rocket Ground Zero are all public team based map icons that show up for both factions.
    
    Rocket Site - Shows when a rocket site is present.
    Rocket Site With Rocket - Shows when a rocket site has a rocket present.
    Rocket Target - Shows when a rocket has targeted a location for launch.
    Rocket Ground Zero - Shows when a rocket has hit the targeted location.
    If you wish to write logic that corresponds to a rocket hitting a location, then relying on a Rocket Ground Zero appearing is the best option.
    ## Rate Limiting and Caching
    We ask that you respect the caching headers as returned by the API. They reflect the lifetime of the data returned in the body of the request and requests sooner than the cache expiry will return the same data.
    
    The API fully supports ETags. API responses include the ETag header. When you make an API request, include the If-None-Match header with the value of the ETag you last received from that endpoint. If the server returns 304 Not Modified, then your cached data is still the latest version.
    
    It is good practice to use the ETag, as even though the cache may have expired the underlying data may not have changed. For example in the case of dynamic map data, if no bases have changed teams within 5 minutes, the cache will have expired but requests using the ETag will return 304 Not Modified, preventing wasting bandwidth on duplicate data.

            The number of required victory towns that's returned by this endpoint represents a static configuration value
            and does not take any scorched victory towns into account.
            This means that if you wish to determine how many victory towns are required to win the war,
            you must reduce it by one for each scorched victory town.
            A scorched victory town is any map item that has both the IsVictoryBase and IsScorched flags set.
